# 🧩 zip-split-bypass

**Bypass fake split-volume ZIPs and recover files from ZIPs that falsely present as multi-part archives.**

Some ZIP files are crafted in a way that tricks common unzip tools (like Windows Explorer, WinRAR, 7-Zip, and Python's zipfile module) into thinking the archive is part of a split volume set. These ZIPs worked fine in its intended environment, but refuse to extract normally, reporting errors like:

> 🗣 "You need to have the following volume to continue extraction: [FILENAME].z01"

This repository provides **working solutions** to recover the actual contents of such ZIP files.

## 🔍 Motivation

This project started when I investigated a ZIP file that appeared broken to every standard extraction tool, yet functioned perfectly within its intended application (such as a Minecraft datapack). A closer look revealed it wasn't a true multi-part archive but a "fake split" archive — a fully valid ZIP file containing all necessary data, cleverly disguised to resemble part of a multi-volume archive. This manipulation effectively misleads unzip utilities into thinking additional parts are missing, causing extraction to fail and confusing users.

My goal is to empower users to recover files from these deceptive ZIPs without needing deep technical knowledge or complex command-line gymnastics.

## 📚 Background: Understanding the Trick

ZIP files store an index of their contents — known as the **central directory** — at the very end of the archive. Most extraction tools (including Windows Explorer, 7-Zip, WinRAR, and Python's `zipfile` module) rely heavily on this directory to locate and extract file data.

In **genuine multi-volume ZIP archives**, this central directory is expected to appear *only* in the **final volume** (typically the one with the `.zip` extension), while earlier segments are named `.z01`, `.z02`, and so on.

The "fake split" ZIPs exploit this behavior by **intentionally placing the central directory at a nonstandard offset within a single `.zip` file**. This causes compliant tools to **misidentify them as incomplete split archives**. As a result, these tools refuse to open the file and demand missing volumes, even though the file is complete and all data is present.

This technique is sometimes used to:

* 🛡️ Bypass automated extraction tools
* 🕵️ "Obfuscate" the archive contents
* 🔒 Prevent casual inspection or tampering
* 💥 Trigger false "corrupt archive" errors in common software

Despite this manipulation, the archive remains structurally valid — the contents are intact, just **mislabeled or offset** to fool standard extraction tools.

The key to bypassing this is that **Java’s `jar` tool does not perform strict volume validation** and instead reads directly from the central directory, regardless of its apparent offset within the file.

## ✅ Classic Method: Java’s `jar xf`

The most reliable and straightforward solution is to use Java’s built-in `jar` tool.

### 🛠 Steps (Manual Extraction)

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the problematic ZIP file
3.  Execute the following command:

    ```sh
    jar xf [FILENAME].zip
    ```
    (Replace `[FILENAME].zip` with the actual name of your file)

* **Effective:** Works even if other tools report errors or demand missing volumes
* **Preserves Structure:** Correctly extracts file and folder names
* **Minimal Setup:** Requires only a standard Java installation (JDK or JRE)

## 🖱️ (RECOMMENDED) One-Click Method for Non-Technical Users

For a user-friendly experience, use `quick_extract.py` — a zero-config script that prompts for your ZIP and extracts it automatically using the Java method.

### 📦 `quick_extract.py`

* Prompts you to select the fake ZIP file
* Extracts using Java’s `jar xf`
* Outputs files into a folder named after the ZIP

> Example: `Downloads/fake.zip` will be extracted to `Downloads/fake/`.

#### ▶️ To run:

1. Make sure you have **Java installed**
2. Install Python 3 if you don’t have it
3. Double-click `quick_extract.py` or run it with:

```sh
python quick_extract.py
```

> ✅ Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project originated from a reverse-engineering effort of a ZIP file that resisted traditional extraction methods, appearing corrupt or incomplete due to intentionally manipulated headers. Special thanks to:

* The Minecraft datapack community, for surfacing creative use cases and examples of such archives
* The authors of Python’s `zipfile` module and Java’s `jar` utility
* The creators of ZIP specs and unzip tools, whose limitations led to this creative workaround
